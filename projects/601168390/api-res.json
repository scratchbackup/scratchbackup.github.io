  "instructions": "HEADPHONE WARNING: Turn down your volume!\nUSE FULLSCREEN FOR BEST EXPERIENCE\n\nWelcome to \"Mars Rover - A Platformer!\" Use left and right arrow keys or A and D keys to move the rover. There's a catch though - you can't jump, because you're a rover. The levels are of course built for that, but some might be similar to levels you would see in a normal platformer with jumping enabled.\n\nOn the last level (9), you have to move the rover to the rocketship and touch it to win. Sorry for the confusion.",
