Commenting has had to be temporarily disabled!\n\n★ Subscribe to me on YouTube for our my helpful videos on Scratch coding :) - Search up \"griffpatch\".\n\n★ Scratch auto disabled comments on this project because it was slowing things down :(\n\n28 Oct 2021 - v11.6 - Fixed offscreen sprites, Fixed 16 & 18 numbers switched, Updated buttons on main screen.\n17 Mar 2020 - v11.5 - Tidied costumes removing nasty ghost outlines, added support for scratch 3 scrolling off screen workaround, fixed tile misaligned glitch, added a couple of missing costumes, fixed hunger system.\n17 Mar 2020 - v11.4 - Updated splash page\n8 Dec 2015 - 6 MILLION VIEWS *grin*\n15 Sep 2015 - 5 MILLION VIEWS! Gosh :)\n14 Jan 2015 - v11.3 - ★ Updated Save Game code to incorporate @TheLogFather 's clever method of bypassing the 10k string (and therefore save game) limit.\n\n15 Dec 2014 - v11.2 - ★ Rain weather (New command '/weather <rain, snow, clear>'.\n\n12 Dec 2014 - v11.1 - ★ Snow weather (it can now snow in most biomes, and the snow will start to settle...).\n\n12 Dec 2014 - v11.0 - ★ Snowy Biomes... (1 in 10 so get looking!)\n\n11 Dec 2014 - v10.9 - ★ Endermen (initial version)\n\n10 Dec 2014 - v10.8 - ★ Villagers naturally spawn in villages, ★ Villagers like to be in their houses at night, ★ Villagers open and close wooden doors, ★ Fixed mob attack distance bug.\n\n09 Dec 2014 - v10.7 - ★ Zombie Pigmen Spawn Eggs, ★ Villager Spawn Eggs (Still more to do on these mobs)\n\n08 Dec 2014 - v10.6b - ★ Naturally spawning villages (no villagers yet), ★ More reliable game startup, ★ Simple pause screen [p], ★ Fixed death respawn bug, ★ Added Sprinting (hold down shift or control)\n\n06 Dec 2014 - v10.5 - Added skin selection to New Game screen, and saved skin selection with saved games (or /skin command).\n\n04 Dec 2014 - v10.2 - There are now 4 spawnable village buildings, plus I've added the fence post block (you can place this by placing a fence at the point you are standing rather than to the side)\n\n02 Dec 2014 - Scratch Team silently placed a limit on the notes and credits section so I've removed my change log :(.\n\n01 Dec 2014 - v10.0 - We made it! Made it to version 10 woop! After all that work I am feeling strangely hungry?\n\nThe mechanics of hunger --> ★ Steve has 20 hunger points (displayed as 10 chops), ★ Steve has 80 food saturation points (which are not displayed), ★ As you walk, jump and mine, your food saturation points are reduced, ★ Once the saturation drops to 0, you begin to lose hunger points, ★ Eating food increases both the food saturation points and the hunger bar together, ★ The outcome of this? - Eat 3 healthy meals a day *grin* - snacking food will cause you to be hungry again much sooner! ★ Health now only regenerated when you have 18 or more hunger points, ★ Health depletes when you have 0 hunger points.\n\n14 Oct 2014 - 2 MILLION VIEWS! That's Awesome!\n23 July 2014 - Passed 1,500,000 Views... wow! :)\n08 May 2014 - 1 million views!!! YAY!!!
